### Project 1: Coffee Bean Classification
- - -
Description:
This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify coffee beans based on their country of origin. The dataset includes various features such as taste, aroma, production year, farm name, and bean variety. The key challenge was to preprocess the data effectively to handle missing values and diverse data types. After preprocessing, the data was used to train and evaluate different machine learning models to achieve accurate classification.

### Project 2: Lung Cancer Mortality Prediction
---
Description:
This project focuses on predicting the mortality of lung cancer patients using clinical data. The dataset comprises 10,000 records with 33 features, including both categorical and numerical data. Significant preprocessing steps included one-hot encoding of categorical variables, conversion of height and weight to BMI, and addressing class imbalance through techniques like SMOTETomek. Various machine learning models were explored, with XGBoost emerging as the most effective after hyperparameter tuning. The model's performance was primarily evaluated using the weighted F1 score due to the imbalanced nature of the data.

### Project 3: Image Classification with Vision Transformers
---
Description:
This project aims to classify scene images into different categories using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The dataset included a variety of image classes, and preprocessing involved resizing and normalizing the images. The ViT model was fine-tuned, and its performance was assessed through metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix. The project highlights the application of transformer-based models to image classification tasks, showcasing their effectiveness in handling diverse image data.
